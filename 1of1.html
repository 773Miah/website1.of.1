INTRO:About hoodbaby: there's not much to know but i won't leave you hanging. 
My real name is Jeremiah Sincere Whickum Ray, and I'm a professional hustler. What that means is wherever the money is, that's where I'm going.
 And I'll get it by any means necessary. I'm 17 years old from Chicago, IL. i Rap, i draw, i sell common wants and needs, i pretty much do it all but fail. I've been all by myself all my life so one bad thing about me is that i wont recognize help like i don't need it.
  But all in all im a HoodBaby.

     Q~3:Howd you get your name?
   </h1>

<h2>

   JWR: I thought of the name hoodbaby because everytime i talked to my momma about where we came from it was always more than just the hood.
   It was mud, it was gutter, it was the heights, so all I knew is the place where I came from which in long to short is the hood.
    And you can take a baby out the Hood but you can't take no Hood out that Baby.
